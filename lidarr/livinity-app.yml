description: 'Lidarr is a music collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new albums from your favorite artists and will interface with clients and indexers to grab, sort, and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of existing files in the library when a better quality format becomes available.


  🛠️ SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

  Lidarr on livosOS will automatically connect to download clients installed from the LivOS App Store. Choose from Transmission, qBittorerent, and SABnzbd. Simply install your preferred client(s).


  All you need to do from there is add an indexer so Lidarr can search for music. You can add indexers directly within Lidarr, or install Prowlarr from the LivOS App Store for easier management of indexers across multiple apps. Add your indexers to Prowlarr and they will be automatically available in Lidarr.'
