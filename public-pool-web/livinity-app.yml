description: "Public Pool's Web provides a sleek, user-friendly interface for managing and monitoring your Public Pool's data. \n\nBuilt with Rails 8.0 and modern web technologies, it offers real-time updates, detailed analytics, and comprehensive pool management features.\n\nFeatures:\n  - Add user\n  - Add worker\n  - Change theme\n  - Sidekiq web interface ( to check background jobs, usually you do not mess with it )\n\n\n⚠️ Notes:\n  - Change host IP ( and port is needed ) of your pool. ( Public Pool doesn't expose its IP yet ) \n  - If you change host IP and port of the pool, restart the application in livos OS. Otherwise, sidekiq will not see them.\n\n\nThis is a hobby project!\n"
