description: '🖨️ A modern and responsive user interface for Klipper. Control and monitor your printer from everywhere, from any device.


  **Easy to use.** The focus lies on both anticipating what users may need to do and ensuring that the user interface contains elements that are easily accessible, understandable, and user-friendly to make those actions easier.


  **Always one step ahead.** We work closely with developers of other projects so that functions can already be implemented early on.


  **100% open source.** Anyone can join, anyone can contribute.'
