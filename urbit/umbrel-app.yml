description: 'Urbit is a personal server for self-sovereign personal & networked computing. Nock, a functional combinator, is built into Hoon, a system programming language, used to implement Arvo, a deterministic operating system, that communicates over Ames, a decentralized, encrypted P2P network.


  This app helps you boot and manage Urbit instances on your LivOS. It provides a simple management GUI, start and stop operations, and passes your +code through the interface.
