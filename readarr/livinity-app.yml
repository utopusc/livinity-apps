description: '⚠️ Removal Notice: The Readarr app has been retired by the developers. More information can be found here: https://github.com/Readarr/Readarr


  ⚠️ Readarr is currently in beta testing and is generally still a work in progress. Features may be broken, incomplete, or cause spontaneous combustion.


  Readarr is an ebook and audiobook collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new books from your favorite authors and will grab, sort, and rename them. Note that only one type of a given book is supported. If you want both an audiobook and ebook of a given book you will need multiple instances.


  🛠️ SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

  Readarr on livosOS will automatically connect to download clients installed from the LivOS App Store. Choose from Transmission, qBittorerent, and SABnzbd. Simply install your preferred client(s).


  All you need to do from there is add an indexer so Readarr can search for books. You can add indexers directly within Readarr, or install Prowlarr from the LivOS App Store for easier management of indexers across multiple apps. Add your indexers to Prowlarr and they will be automatically available in Readarr.'
