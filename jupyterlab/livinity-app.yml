description: "JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter. \n\nIt enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner. You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters.\n\nKey features and workflows include:\n  - Code Consoles for interactive code execution and linking to a notebook kernel.\n  - Kernel-backed documents that allow code in any text file (Markdown, Python, LaTeX) to be run interactively.\n  - Mirrored cell outputs for simple dashboards.\n  - Multiple views of documents with different editors or viewers (e.g., live preview of Markdown or CSV).\n  - A unified model for viewing and handling data formats (images, CSV, JSON, PDF, Vega, etc.).\n  - Customizable keyboard shortcuts and an extensible architecture.\n\n\nJupyterLab uses the same notebook document format as the classic\
  \ Jupyter Notebook."
