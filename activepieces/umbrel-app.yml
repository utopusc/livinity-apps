tagline: Your friendliest open source AI automation tool
description: "\U0001F92F Welcome to Activepieces\n\nYour friendliest open source all-in-one automation tool, designed to be extensible through a type-safe pieces framework written in Typescript.\n\n\n\U0001F525 Why Activepieces is Different:\n  - \U0001F496 Loved by Everyone: Intuitive interface and great experience for both technical and non-technical users with a quick learning curve.\n\n  - \U0001F310 Open Ecosystem: All pieces are open source and available on npmjs.com, 60% of the pieces are contributed by the community.\n\n  - \U0001F6E0️ Pieces are written in Typescript: Pieces are npm packages in TypeScript, offering full customization with the best developer experience, including hot reloading for local piece development on your machine. \U0001F60E\n\n  - \U0001F916 AI-Ready: Native AI pieces let you experiment with various providers, or create your own agents using our AI SDK, and there is Copilot to help you build flows inside the builder.\n\n  - \U0001F3E2 Enterprise-Ready: Developers\
  \ set up the tools, and anyone in the organization can use the no-code builder. Full customization from branding to control.\n\n  - \U0001F512 Secure by Design: Self-hosted and network-gapped for maximum security and control over your data.\n\n  - \U0001F9E0 Human in the Loop: Delay execution for a period of time or require approval. These are just pieces built on top of the piece framework, and you can build many pieces like that. \U0001F3A8\n\n  - \U0001F4BB Human Input Interfaces: Built-in support for human input triggers like \"Chat Interface\" \U0001F4AC and \"Form Interface\" \U0001F4DD"
