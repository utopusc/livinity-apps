description: "rotki is an open source portfolio tracking, analytics, accounting and tax reporting tool that protects your privacy. \n\nThe mission of rotki is to bring transparency into the crypto and financial sectors through the use of open source. \n\nMost importantly unlike virtually every other competing service which consists of closed source SaaS onto which you are forced to hand over all your financial data, with rotki your data is stored encrypted locally in your computer. \n\nIt enables you to take ownership of your financial data!\n\n⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️ Rotki is meant to be accessed locally. Hosting it on a publicly accessible machine should be avoided at all cost, unless you know what you're doing!"

releaseNotes: "This is a patch release fixing issues reported over the past three weeks.\n\nKey improvements include:\n  - Fixed the queries of historical events on Optimism, Base, and BSC with new customizable indexers (Blockscout and Routescan)\n  - Support for new formats of Coinbase API keys\n  - Proper decoding of Cowswap transactions on Polygon\n  - Fixed duplicated Binance events from CSV imports\n  - Improved date/time range selector in the PnL report generation menu\n  - Support for Yearn staking transactions\n  - Better handling of Binance CSV imports with multiple trades\n\n\n⚠️ For users importing events from Binance CSV imports: In order to not have duplicate events, from this release and on, please purge your existing Binance data and re-import.\n\n⚠️ As always when upgrading, all your EVM history events will need to be redecoded. This takes time depending on the amount of events but is required to apply all changes.\n\nFull release notes are found at https://github.com/rotki/rotki/releases"
