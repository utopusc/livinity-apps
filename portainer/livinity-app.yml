tagline: Run custom Docker containers on your LivOS
description: '⚠️ Make sure to only use named Docker volumes for your stacks and containers. Data in bind-mounted volumes will be lost when the Portainer app is restarted or updated.


  ⚠️ Watch out for port conflicts between your custom Docker containers and your livosOS apps.


  Portainer is the ultimate Docker management solution that simplifies running Docker containers and Docker Compose setups on your LivOS, putting comprehensive control at your fingertips.


  Portainer provides seamless container management, allowing you to efficiently monitor, start, stop, and modify containers, networks, volumes, and images. You can also deploy multi-container applications using Docker Compose with ease.


  🛠️ Portainer on LivOS is for power users, follow these best practices to avoid issues:


  1. Data persistence: Make sure to only used named Docker volumes for your stacks and containers. Data in bind-mounted volumes will be lost when the Portainer app is restarted or updated.


  2. Port management: Watch out for potential port conflicts between your custom containers and livosOS'' service containers, apps you have installed from the LivOS App Store or Community App Stores, and any apps you go to install in the future.


  3. Container restart policy: Set your containers to "unless-stopped" or "always" restart policies. This will allow your containers to restart automatically when the Portainer app is restarted or updated.


  4. Web access to containers: Access your custom containers in your browser at livos.local:PORT_NUMBER. For example, for a container with a web UI running on port 4545, navigate to livos.local:4545 to access it.'
