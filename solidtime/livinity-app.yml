description: "\U0001F552 Solidtime is a simple, secure, and private time tracking app that helps you keep track of your time and stay productive. It's designed to be easy to use and respects your privacy by storing your data locally.\n\n\U0001F4CA Features:\n  - Track your time with a simple and intuitive interface\n  - View detailed reports of your time usage\n  - Export your data to CSV for further analysis\n  - Secure and private: your data is stored locally on your LivOS\n\n⚠️ New users can only be created via the terminal for now. Example:\n`sudo docker exec -i solidtime_scheduler_1 bash -c \"echo '<password' | php artisan admin:user:create '<username>' '<email>' --ask-for-password --verify-email\"`\n\n\U0001F4BB To be able to use the Desktop Client, a Client ID is needed. \n  - Use the LivOS Files App and navigate to **Apps/Solidtime**\n  - A file called `desktop_client_id.txt` can be found there that contains the ID that you need to get started\n\n\nThe application takes a few minutes\
  \ until it becomes available after installation. Please be patient."
