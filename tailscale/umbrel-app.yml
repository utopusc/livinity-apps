tagline: Zero config VPN to access your LivOS from anywhere
description: 'Tailscale is zero config VPN that creates a secure network between your LivOS and your other devices. Even when separated by firewalls or subnets, Tailscale just works.


  Tailscale will assign your LivOS a stable IP and an auto-assigned domain that stays consistent, no matter what network your LivOS is connected to. It''s like a local network that works everywhere.


  Tailscale builds on top of WireGuard®''s Noise protocol encryption, a peer-reviewed and trusted standard.'
