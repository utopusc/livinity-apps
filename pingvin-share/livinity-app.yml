description: "Pingvin Share is self-hosted file sharing platform and an alternative for WeTransfer.\n\n\U0001F6E0️ To use Pingvin Share as intended you may need to expose it to the public internet. The easiest way to do this is to download the 'Cloudflare Tunnel' app from the livos app store, and expose Pingvin Share (running on port 6453) using your own domain.\n\n✨ Features\n  - Share files using a link\n  - Unlimited file size (restricted only by disk space)\n  - Set an expiration date for shares\n  - Secure shares with visitor limits and passwords\n  - Email recipients\n  - Reverse shares\n  - OIDC and LDAP authentication"
