description: '📼 copyparty is a lightweight yet incredibly powerful file sharing platform designed to give you complete control over your data. It transforms any environment into a personal and fully featured file hub where you can upload, download, edit, and organize files directly through an intuitive web interface. Everything happens in the browser without the need for additional software, making it fast, convenient, and accessible from virtually anywhere.


  At its core, copyparty is built around simplicity and flexibility. It supports multiple standard protocols such as HTTP, WebDAV, and FTP, allowing seamless integration with a wide range of clients and devices. You can drag and drop files into the browser, create folders, manage permissions, and instantly share links with others. Whether you want to host a temporary upload area, organize long term archives, or maintain a personal workspace, copyparty adapts to your needs without complexity.


  Beyond basic file management, copyparty includes advanced tools that make it much more than a typical file server. It comes with an integrated media player for streaming music and videos directly from your library, along with text and Markdown editors for in browser document editing. You can tag files, perform instant searches across large directories, and even restore previous versions of files when needed.


  Security and customization are also at the heart of copyparty’s design. It offers granular user access controls, password protection, and finely tuned configuration options to match your workflow. The interface can be completely restyled with custom CSS themes, making it easy to create a personalized look and feel.


  In essence, copyparty is not just a file server but a flexible and elegant file management ecosystem. It can serve as a private cloud, a collaborative workspace, or a full featured digital archive, combining performance, simplicity, and freedom in one compact application.'
