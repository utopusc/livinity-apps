Budibase applications have performance baked in and can be designed responsively, providing users with a great experience. \n\n\U0001F5C4️ Load data or start from scratch\nBudibase pulls data from multiple sources, including MongoDB, CouchDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Airtable, S3, DynamoDB, or a REST API. And unlike other platforms, with Budibase you can start from scratch and create business apps with no data sources.\n\n\U0001F3A8 Design and build apps with powerful pre-made components\nBudibase comes out of the box with beautifully designed, powerful components which you can use like building blocks to build your UI. We also expose many of your favourite CSS styling options so you can go that extra creative mile.\n\n⚙️ Automate\
