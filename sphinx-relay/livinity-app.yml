description: 'Sphinx Relay turns your Lightning node into a personal communication server. Messages are end-to-end encrypted and transmitted over the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Download Sphinx on your phone from https://sphinx.chat and pair it with Sphinx Relay on LivOS.


  Communication between Sphinx Relay nodes takes place entirely on the Lightning Network, so it is decentralized, untraceable, and encrypted. Messages are encrypted using client public keys on the Sphinx app.


  You can join tribes at https://tribes.sphinx.chat. If you join a podcast tribe, you can listen to the podcast in Sphinx and stream donations to the host.'
