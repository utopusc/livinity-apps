description: 'Overseerr is a request management and media discovery tool built to work with your existing Plex ecosystem.


  Overseerr scans your Plex libraries at regular intervals, so it knows which items are already available on your server. It also integrates with the popular DVR applications Radarr and Sonarr, and supports activity monitoring within Overseerr itself.
